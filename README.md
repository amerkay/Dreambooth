# Dreambooth-style fine tuning of Stable Diffusion models

A notebook for training Stable Diffusion models 

There are lots of notebooks for Dreambooth-style training. This one is distinguished by a couple of features:
* based on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) [DiffusersðŸ§¨](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) implementation so it's easy to stay up-to-date with rapid access to new features
* exposes lesser-known parameters for experimentation 
* track/visualize training loss and prior class loss
* easily switch in different variational autoencoders (VAE) or text encoders
* option to generate exponentially-weighted moving average (EMA) weights
* inference with trained models is done using [DiffusersðŸ§¨](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) pipelines, does not rely on any web-apps
